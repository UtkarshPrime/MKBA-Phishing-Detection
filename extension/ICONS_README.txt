ICON PLACEHOLDERS

The icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) are currently placeholders.

To add real icons:

1. Create or download shield/security icons in PNG format
2. Resize to 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
3. Replace the placeholder files with your actual icons

Recommended icon style:
- Shield with checkmark or lock symbol
- Blue/green color scheme for security
- Simple, recognizable design

Free icon resources:
- https://www.flaticon.com (search "shield security")
- https://icons8.com (search "phishing protection")
- https://www.iconfinder.com (search "security shield")

Or create your own using:
- Canva (free online design tool)
- GIMP (free image editor)
- Figma (free design tool)

The extension will still work with placeholder icons, but custom icons
will make it look more professional.
